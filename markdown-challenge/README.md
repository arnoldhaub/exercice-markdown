# MY FIRST MARKDOWN PAGE

## Who am I ?

It is a question that I often hear. To be honest with you, tt is kind of **hard to answer** to it. This question can be asked at every second of our life, and receive a different anwser everytime as well.

But I am not going to write an essay. I will just keep it short. I am **29 years old** guy named ***Arnold***, living in **Brussels**.

### Most surprising skills.

My three *most surprising skills* are :
- I am a _fast-learner_.
- I can **write about anything**.
- ***My imagination has no limit***.

### Things I like the most.

> The three things I like the most in the universe are :
1. #### Being on my own.
I really like my own company and, in a certain way, I often need to isolate myself from other if I want to be fully present and enjoy the time with others.
2. #### Feeling free.
It is so important to me to feel that I can do and be whatever I feel like. Otherwise I can feel that something is dying in myself.
3. #### Create.
I have always created things : stories, projects, etc. It is something I need in my life, being able to create.

## Objectives
> What are the **objectives** I want to achieve
>> as a **developer** during _BeCode_. 

Excellent question ! Hard to answer again. You never really know the answer until you find it. But to keep it short and simple, let's say that I want to become a developer and being able to create website, application, etc. 

I do not know yet where I want to go but I am open to everything. I am sure that this training will help me to discover which side of the force I should follow.

## Fears.

Things are getting deep ! Well, I have a couple. I fear to not be a good developer, to have choosen the wrong path, to not have the "profile". I also want to develop my writing aside of this training, and I do not know if I will be capable of handling both.

I am also fearing getting bored of always working on computer. But we will see, life has so much to show us.

## Things I look forward to.

You are kind of curious, are not you ? I am looking forward to everything, to the project we will create, to the level we will get, to the future internship we will follow. I am kind of curious for all these things. There is so much to learn and to discover, and I can not wait to see the future coming.

## Work as a team.

> What are the three things I value the most to work as a team ?

I do not know if I am a good team-player. I am kind of a loner, working alone, independantly.

- Freedom of speech.
It is important to create a space where everyone can express himself without feeling judge or limited.
- Respect.
Respecting others, talk in a kind way without assuming that someone is bette than an other.
- Fun.
Let's stay playful. Focus on the project, serious when we have to, but like kids most of the time.

## Favorite GIF.
There are too many. I will just share one that I found funny. I found it on Google typing:" GIF", do no judge me on my effort.
